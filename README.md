# Cardinal

Cardinal is an app designed to streamline the textbook to knowledge process. Oftentimes, flash card apps provide a UI where each card will be individually created and managed. With Cardinal we introduce a more efficient approach of defining cards. Cardinal uses markdown files to extract cards. A card has the following structure:

Cardinal is an app designed to streamline the process of transforming textbooks
into knowledge. Unlike typical flashcard apps that require you to create and
manage each card individually through a UI, Cardinal offers a more efficient
approach: defining cards directly within your markdown files.

1. Card title: H1 `# Title`
2. Front page: Content following the first H2 `## Some irrelevant string`
3. Back page: Content following the second H2 `## Some irrelevant string`

This approach lets you use your favorite text editor—like Nvim—to create and
edit cards in the most efficient and flexible way possible.
